## Network Scanner

This Python script is a simple network scanner that allows users to discover devices on a network and scan open ports on a specific device.

### Features:
- **Device Discovery:** Users can scan a network range to discover devices and their corresponding MAC addresses.
- **Port Scanning:** Users can scan for open ports on a specified device within a network range.
- **Port Scan Options:** Supports scanning the top 100 ports, top 1000 ports, or a custom range of ports.
- **Output to File:** Results of the port scan are saved to a text file (**Live**), allowing users to review the findings later. This output file is live so if you killed the script by accident it will store the already processed ports in the file.

### Usage:
1. First git clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/mridiot0/Simple_network_scanner && cd Simple_network_scanner`
2. Input the necessary parameters, such as network range or host IP, depending on the chosen option.
3. When using top 1000 ports it will ask for the file path of the top 1000 ports file it is included in the repo just type `top1000ports.txt` when asked
 `Enter the path to the file containing port numbers:` you can even modify the file in `top1000ports.txt` to meet your needs.

### Dependencies:
- [`scapy`](https://pypi.org/project/scapy/): For crafting and sending packets on the network. Install via pip: `pip install scapy`
- [`colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/): For adding color and style to console output. Install via pip: `pip install colorama`

### Note:
- Ensure proper permissions and dependencies are installed before running the script.
- This script is for educational and informational purposes only. Use responsibly and respect the privacy and security of network devices.
- Any issues tell me I'll be happy to hammer my head into this ðŸ™‚.
